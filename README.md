# Blockhead-Bill

Help Blockhead Bill finish up his shift at the post office by handing out packages to some pesky patrons – but be careful, take too long and you’ll cost the company overtime!

Pick boxes off the line and hand them to the right customers! Although their descriptions might be less than helpful, you can connect the dots by referencing your manifest for the day.

Made by Prismapunch Games for Ludum Dare 53.
